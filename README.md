   Customer Lifetime Value Model

  # Overview
Developed a simple CLV model to estimate customer profitability based on:
- Account tenure
- Transaction patterns
- 0.1% profit assumption per transaction

  # Implementation

1.   Transaction Metrics Calculation  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     customer_id,
     COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,
     SUM(amount) AS total_amount,
     AVG(amount) AS avg_amount
   FROM transactions
   WHERE status = 'success' 
     AND amount > 0
   GROUP BY customer_id
   ```

2.   Account Tenure Determination  
   ```sql
   TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, signup_date, CURRENT_DATE) AS tenure_months
   WHERE signup_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
   ```

3.   CLV Calculation Formula  
   ```
   CLV = (transactions/tenure) * 12 * (avg_amount * 0.001)
   ```
   - Annualizes transaction rate
   - Applies 0.1% profit margin

4.   Result Formatting  
   - Rounded to 2 decimal places
   - High-value customers first

  # Challenges Solved

| Challenge | Solution |

| New customers (division by zero) | `NULLIF` and tenure > 0 check |
| Invalid transactions | Filters for success/positive amounts |
| Name formatting | `CONCAT(COALESCE(first_name,''), ' ', COALESCE(last_name,''))` |
| Profit calculation | Explicit 0.001 multiplier |

  # Business Value
- Identifies high-profit customers for retention
- Guides acquisition strategy
- Simple, explainable model for marketing teams

   Common Technical Approaches

| Technique | Applications |
|-----------|-------------|
| `CASE` Statements | Plan type labeling, frequency categorization |
| Date Functions | Tenure calculation, inactivity detection, monthly aggregation |
| `COALESCE`/`NULLIF` | Handling missing data, preventing calculation errors |
| Nested Aggregations | Multi-level metrics (monthly â†’ customer) |
| Performance Filters | Early data filtering in all solutions |
